            allowed the same signal to drive both black-and-white and color televisions,
            but JPEG images use YCbCr primarily because it allows the color data to be
            optionally subsampled for the purposes of reducing bandwidth or disk
            space.  YCbCr is the most common JPEG colorspace, and YCbCr JPEG images

            decompressing, the X component is guaranteed to be 0xFF, which can be

            <summary>
            CMYK pixel format.  Unlike RGB, which is an additive color model used
            primarily for display, CMYK (Cyan/Magenta/Yellow/Key) is a subtractive
            color model used primarily for printing.  In the CMYK color model, the
            value of each color component typically corresponds to an amount of cyan,
            magenta, yellow, or black ink that is applied to a white background.  In
            order to convert between CMYK and RGB, it is necessary to use a color
            management system (CMS.)  A CMS will attempt to map colors within the
            printer's gamut to perceptually similar colors in the display's gamut and
            vice versa, but the mapping is typically not 1:1 or reversible, nor can it
            be defined with a simple formula.  Thus, such a conversion is out of scope
            for a codec library.  However, the TurboJPEG API allows for compressing
            CMYK pixels into a YCCK JPEG image (see #TJCS_YCCK) and decompressing YCCK
            JPEG images into CMYK pixels.

                Losslessly transform a JPEG image into another JPEG image.  Lossless
                transforms work by moving the raw DCT coefficients from one JPEG image
                structure to another without altering the values of the coefficients.  While
                this is typically faster than decompressing the image, transforming it, and
                re-compressing it, lossless transforms are not free.  Each lossless
                transform requires reading and performing Huffman decoding on all of the
                coefficients in the source image, regardless of the size of the destination
                image.  Thus, this function provides a means of generating multiple
